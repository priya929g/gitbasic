    <h1>Things I Learned from 6/27 Session</h1>

    <ul>
        <li> Goal is to make a scoreboard system with yourself + including all the skills
            you have learned the past X weeks
        </li>
        <li> Why? Helps to see how many progress you have made and helps to deter yourself comparing
            yourself to others
        </li>
        <li> Keeping track of tasks completed: starting a repo, creating a GitHub account,
            creating an instance in AWS, uploading boilerplate code for different languages in GitHub
        </li>
    </ul>
